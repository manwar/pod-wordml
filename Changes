Revision history for Perl module Pod::WordML

0.16 - Sun Jan  5 22:26:14 2014

0.15 - Fri Jan  3 13:26:50 2014
	* Update the expected output to make the tests pass
	* Get rid of MYMETA

0.13 - Mon Nov 16 04:37:32 2009
	* The claim that I handled =item, em dashes, and ellipsis

	time.

0.12 - Sun Nov 15 22:04:18 2009
	* Handle =item
